Some small typos in file names and titles:
Averge -> Average
lenth -> length

You may want to group your figures together by what they explore. That is,

lenth_of_stay.png
number of visits in each year.png
rent_price.png
unemployment_rate.png

are all plotted over time.

Whereas 
average stay time.png
number of visit.png

are histograms of counts.
