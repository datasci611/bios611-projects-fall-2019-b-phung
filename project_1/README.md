# Project 1: Urban Ministries of Durham

As per their website, [Urban Ministries of Durham](http://www.umdurham.org/ "Urban Ministries of Durham's Homepage") is non-profit organization that provides food and shelter to those in need.

The UMD_Services_Provided data set tracks when clients visit and the sort of assistance that was provided. The most complete variables are "Date", "Client File Number", "Financial Support", "Food Provided for", and "Food Pounds". For each entry, they respectively indicate the following:

| Variable            | Description |
| ---                 |---          |
| Date                | when a client (and their family) visited                                                 |
| Client File Number  | the ID number assigned to them                                                           |
| Financial Support   | the amount of monetary aid given that visit (if any)                                     |
| Food Provided for   | the number of people food was provided for (more than 1 if client brought family members |
| Food Pounds         | total pounds of food provided                                                            |


It would be of interest to investigate any trends involving the frequency of visits, as this is useful to UMD to being more logistically prepared. To take that a level further, we could to group visitors into categories denoting how often they have visited over the years. Because an intermediate goal to eliminating homelessness is in reducing chronic homelessness (as opposed to temporary homelessness), knowing what separates the two might give some insight into this.
