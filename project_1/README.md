# Project 1: Urban Ministries of Durham

As per their website, [Urban Ministries of Durham](http://www.umdurham.org/ "Urban Ministries of Durham's Homepage") is non-profit organization that provides food and shelter to those in need.

The UMD_Services_Prodvided data set tracks when clients visit and the sort of assistance that was provided. The most relevant and complete variables are "Date", "Client File Number", "Financial Support", "Food Provided for", "Food Pounds", and "Clothing Items". It would be of interest to investigate any trends involving the frequency of visits and in particular how UMD was most effectively able to help its clients get back on their feet.


To those assigned to give me feedback: I'll have more stuff by Saturday.
